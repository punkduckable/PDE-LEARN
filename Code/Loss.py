    ith data point. If U is a function of two spatial variables, then this
    should be a three column tensor whose ith row holds the (t, x, y)
    coordinates of the ith data point.

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Arguments:

    U: The Neural Network that approximates the solution.

    Xi: A trainable (requires_grad = True) torch 1D tensor. If there are N
    RHS_Terms, this should be an N element vector.

    Mask: A boolean tensor whose shape matches that of Xi. When adding the kth 
    RHS term to the Library_Xi product, we check if Mask[k] == False. If so, 
    We add 0*Xi[k]. Otherwise, we compute the kth library term as usual.

    Coll_Points: B by n column tensor, where B is the number of coordinates and
    n is the dimension of the problem domain. The ith row of Coll_Points should
    hold the components of the ith collocation points.

    Derivatives: We try to learn a PDE of the form

    that contains each D_j's in each term in the equation above. This list
    should be ordered according to the Derivatives' orders (see Derivative
    class).

    LHS_Term : A Term object representing T_0 in the equation above.

    RHS_Terms : A list of Term objects whose ith entry represents T_i in the
    equation above.

    Device: The device (gpu or cpu) that we train on.

    A tuple. The first entry of the tuple is a scalar tensor whose lone element
    contains the mean square collocation loss at the Coll_Points. The second is a
